- This is a simple method to bypass malicious behavior detections based on parent-child process relationship. Usually when an application starts another executable, the new process has a parent PID assigned which indicates the process that created it. This allows to detect and possibly block malicious intents like for example ```Word/Excel``` application starting ```Powershell```. This technique may be combined with for example process hollowing to achieve more stealth.

- The great thing is that ```CreateProcess``` API lets you provide additional information for process creation, including the one called ```PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS```. Letâ€™s see how to use it - we will create a ```Notepad``` process in a way that it will look like it was spawned by ```explorer.exe```
